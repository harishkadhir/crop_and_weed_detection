## Overview

Crop and Weed Detection is a computer vision project aimed at identifying and distinguishing between crops and weeds in agricultural fields. Using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project offers a solution to automate the process of detecting and classifying plants, thus helping farmers optimize their crop management practices.

## Requirements

To run Crop and Weed Detection, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- ultralytics

You can install these dependencies using pip:
``` !pip install ultralytics```

## How it Works

Crop and Weed Detection leverages deep learning models trained on labeled datasets of images containing crops and weeds. The model is capable of recognizing patterns and features that distinguish between different types of vegetation. By processing input images of agricultural fields, the model can accurately classify and locate crops and weeds.

## Results

After running Crop and Weed Detection, you will see the results displayed on the screen. Additionally, the program will generate an output image highlighting the detected crops and weeds.

The output image will show the identified regions of crops and weeds, helping farmers visualize and analyze the distribution of vegetation in their fields.
